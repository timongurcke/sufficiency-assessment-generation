Seeing national flags be honored may be the most emotional moments to each athlete. When witnessing our national flags flying proudly among others, many of us can stop hiding our pride and happiness. The athlete also seems to be more aware of his responsibilities and he wants to contribute more to his beloved country. For instance, when Vietnam became the champion of SEAGAMES for the first time in 2008, a festival atmosphere permeated into the streets. People from all ages turned out to the streets with flags, banners and they sang aloud songs of Ho Chi Minh President. The eager atmosphere lasted many next days. In fact, some hooligans were so excited that they took part in motor racing or using fireworks illegally. However, the hooligans only took a minority of people. Therefore, it can be said that the SEAGAMES is one of the most important sporting events in the history of Vietnam .\n",

In this way, the crime rate is reduced and society becomes a peaceful place, so the country will develop at a rapid pace.\n",

As we destroy the natural habitat, like forests, jungles and lakes, to make place for our industry and farmland, we rob the ecosystem. To illustrate, every day a massive part of the Rainforest in South America is destroyed to provide wood and farmland. If we don't preserve this important part of our ecosystem many endangered animals will loose their natural habitat and go extinct. As a result, further generations will never have the opportunity to see and study these animals.\n",
