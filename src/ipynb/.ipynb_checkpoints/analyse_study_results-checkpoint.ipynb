For example, <span style=\"background-color: #fdf2d0;\">library is a good place for students to study or research</span>. <span style=\"background-color: #fdf2d0;\">They can concentrate on the subjects with a tranquil ambience; also, there are a lot of references for students to utilize</span>. <span style=\"background-color: #fdf2d0;\">With this convenient and versatile facility, students can improve their learning condition</span>. Therefore, we can commence to agree that <span style=\"background-color: #d8d2e7;\"> the more advanced facilities we have, the better we can learn</span>. </p> <p style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"color: #d8d2e7;\">???</span> = claim&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style=\"color: #fdf2d0;\">???</span> = premise</p>   \n",
       "1  <p>Looking from another perspective, <span style=\"background-color: #d8d2e7;\"> looking from another perspective, there are some people who have left college at a very young age</span>. <span style=\"background-color: #fdf2d0;\">Take for instance those who start their own business</span>. <span style=\"background-color: #fdf2d0;\">These people depend solely on hard work and luck</span>. Interestingly, <span style=\"background-color: #fdf2d0;\">for some of them it proved to be a profitable job</span>. To cite an example, <span style=\"background-color: #fdf2d0;\">Michael Dell who is the founder and the CEO of Dell left college at 19</span>. Initially, <span style=\"background-color: #fdf2d0;\">he started his computer company in his college dorm room</span>. Eventually, <span style=\"background-color: #fdf2d0;\">he used his earnings as well as his family's loan in order to progress to be who he is now</span>.</p> <p style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"color: #d8d2e7;\">???</span> = claim&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style=\"color: #fdf2d0;\">???</span> = premise</p>   \n",

For example, <span style=\"background-color: #fdf2d0;\">when I did not know what major to choose when I attend university, my father told a lot about different majors</span>. <span style=\"background-color: #fdf2d0;\">He shared his own experience with me, which helped me quite a lot</span>. <span style=\"background-color: #fdf2d0;\">Parents are quite experienced than their child</span>, <span style=\"background-color: #fdf2d0;\">they can guide them toward the right direction</span>.
