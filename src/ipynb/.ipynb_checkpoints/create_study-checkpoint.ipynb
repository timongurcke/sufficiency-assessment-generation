Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance, it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach, and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet, and those who are in charge of the medical care. The winner is the athlete but the success belongs to the whole team. Therefore <span style=\"background-color: #d8d2e7;\"> on the other hand, it is very important for the team to cooperate</span>.</p> <p style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"color: #d8d2e7;\">▇▇▇</span> = claim&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style=\"color: #fdf2d0;\">▇▇▇</span> = premise</p>  \n",

Take Australia for example, immigrants from varieties of nations have a day called multicultural day where people from each country prepare their food and traditional activities for displaying in the public venues. Many Australians come this day to enjoy the shows, learn about the cultures and admire the diverse values. These feedbacks, in turn, help raise one’s pride of their cultures and help people understand each other more. Thus this makes it clear that <span style=\"background-color: #d8d2e7;\">Firstly, it is important to maintain one’s cultural identity</span>.</p> <p style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"color: #d8d2e7;\">▇▇▇</span> = claim&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style=\"color: #fdf2d0;\">▇▇▇</span> = premise</p>  \n",

For instance, children immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends. In this new environment, parent should find friends coming from their same country so that they can socialize in a very familiar manner as feeling being home. Fail to create this familiarity makes them felt isolated, in the extreme can lead to social disorder like autism. Hence, it is clear that <span style=\"background-color: #d8d2e7;\">Secondly, it is very important to keep one’s identity</span>.</p> <p style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"color: #d8d2e7;\">▇▇▇</span> = claim&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style=\"color: #fdf2d0;\">▇▇▇</span> = premise</p>  \n",
