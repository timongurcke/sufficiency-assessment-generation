A person can not learn or achieve everything by oneself . For instance , lions hunt in a team . It is only due to their teamwork that they are able to catch a prey and make task easy . In the same way , co-operative approach will save time , energy and will have a higher success rate .    \n",

Holiday makers flocking to other countries are not only bound to spend on tickets of attractions , but also pay for food , accommodation , transportation and entertainment . Both local people and governments can make a large amount of money through these services , and more employment opportunities can be created as well . I also believe the revenue earned form tourism can be used in turn to reduce pollution and protect the environment .    \n",

Firstly , some people leave the rubbish after visiting the attractions . Therefore , those local residents have to clean the place frequently so that the new batch of tourists will have a tidy and neat environment . Moreover , tourists may offend the local people due to their different culture background . For example , Indians don ' t eat beef since they worship cows . Thus , if tourists want to respect the tradition , they will not order any beef in the local restaurant .    \n",

Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance , it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach , and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet , and those who are in charge of the medical care .

The fact is that the more cars and motorbikes are on roads , the more seriously the ozone layer is damaged . If governments use more money to improve roads , there is a strong likelihood that more people drive their private cars work . This is sure to lead to more carbon emitted into the atmosphere , which can cause skin cancer and destroy the natural environment . Whereas , if there are more good buses , trains , or subways , people are inclined to use less private vehicles , which decreases the amount of carbon released . Obviously , the policy that concentrates money on developing public transportation brings an advantageous impact on earth .    \n",

When a product is commonly used , it becomes trustworthy for the society , no matter what quality it is . However , it also has to be affordable for the consumer .

Given the fact that human beings are responsible for the heavy pollution and severe damage to the natural habitats of many wild animals , it is our responsibility to create a natural and safe environment for animals to live in . Apparently , the limited space and the artificial trees and lakes can not fully compensate the animals for their loss . Moreover , if rural animals are captured in the zoo for a long period , it would have negative influences on both the physical and psychological status of the creatures . As a result , the wild species would suffer from isolation and depression . It seems that zoos are more likely to be a killer rather than a protector in protecting wild lives .    \n",
       "117                       To begin with , distance-learning brings significant convenience for students in every corner of the world . In earlier times , students who were tired of commuting had to attend schools nearby , regardless of any differences in teaching facilities , teacher ' s qualifications or the school reputation . Now , however , students are able to apply for online-courses provided by top-of-the-range universities and colleges worldwide . Furthermore , the presence of video conferencing allows a teacher to teach a greater number of students . Consequently , educational institutions are able to optimize costs by increasing teacher-student ratios . Thanks to the economical online-teaching , universities and colleges are able to offer grants for students who have outstanding academic achievements but are unable to attend schools because of financial constrains .    \n",

A child ' s daily life is school , playing and sleeping . For example , when I was young I just came home from school and then I would took my bike or soccer ball and go out and play with my friends in my neighborhood .

For instance , some lecturers in our university read the same text in the reference books for that particular course module . Further , they didn ' t explain the contents in order to understand by the students . It was waste of the time . Because the university students have grown up , they have enough ability to read and understand the text book .

Actually , some questionnaires indicate that if students have taken part-time jobs , they will make the best use of their time to prepare their future and more importantly ; they will not expect too much for their future than students who have not taken the part-time job .
