Thus , during summer there will be a lot of power cut in the developing countries such as India .

On one hand , governments have a macro-economic perspective to control price in various areas according to social demands . Consequently , it seems not easy to increase petrol price instantly . On the other hand , pollutions are not just caused by the burning of oil , chemical pollutants , extra lights , also constitute considerable amount of pollution . In addition , the improvements of work efficiency also attribute to the speed-up of working pace , resulting in traffic jams during rush-hours .    \n",

This is because they have been instilled and imparted the most updated knowledge and skills at universities . Secondly , having a larger proportion of young adults could enhance the working effectiveness and efficiency .

Hence it is always said that competition makes the society more effective . However , when we consider about the question that how to win the game , we always find that we need the cooperation . The greater our goal is , the more competition we need . Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance , it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach , and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet , and those who are in charge of the medical care . The winner is the athlete but the success belongs to the whole team . Therefore without the cooperation , there would be no victory of competition .    \n",

The fact is that the more cars and motorbikes are on roads , the more seriously the ozone layer is damaged . If governments use more money to improve roads , there is a strong likelihood that more people drive their private cars work . This is sure to lead to more carbon emitted into the atmosphere , which can cause skin cancer and destroy the natural environment . Whereas , if there are more good buses , trains , or subways , people are inclined to use less private vehicles , which decreases the amount of carbon released . Obviously , the policy that concentrates money on developing public transportation brings an advantageous impact on earth .    \n",

For instance , the money invested into physical education program can save allocations into healthcare , since the nation is comparatively healthy . Along with that , physically healthy people can contribute more both into economical and social development . As a matter of fact , the better a person feels , the better his brain works . Therefore , putting physical activities in early steps of human development would finally lead to mentally healthy society . As hence it ends up with financially competitive country .    \n",

Advertisement is the most effective way to create a well-known product . Consumers tend to purchase the most known product when it comes to picking one out of two different brands of the same product . When a product is commonly used , it becomes trustworthy for the society , no matter what quality it is . However , it also has to be affordable for the consumer . Considering this fact , advertisements have undeniable affects on the society about the product being advertised . They make the product preferable .    \n",

Given the fact that human beings are responsible for the heavy pollution and severe damage to the natural habitats of many wild animals , it is our responsibility to create a natural and safe environment for animals to live in . Apparently , the limited space and the artificial trees and lakes can not fully compensate the animals for their loss . Moreover , if rural animals are captured in the zoo for a long period , it would have negative influences on both the physical and psychological status of the creatures . As a result , the wild species would suffer from isolation and depression . It seems that zoos are more likely to be a killer rather than a protector in protecting wild lives .    \n",
       "117                       To begin with , distance-learning brings significant convenience for students in every corner of the world . In earlier times , students who were tired of commuting had to attend schools nearby , regardless of any differences in teaching facilities , teacher ' s qualifications or the school reputation . Now , however , students are able to apply for online-courses provided by top-of-the-range universities and colleges worldwide . Furthermore , the presence of video conferencing allows a teacher to teach a greater number of students . Consequently , educational institutions are able to optimize costs by increasing teacher-student ratios . Thanks to the economical online-teaching , universities and colleges are able to offer grants for students who have outstanding academic achievements but are unable to attend schools because of financial constrains .    \n",

All professors and students need to have a modern and well-equipped library because , after internet , library plays an important role in research . Although sport is important , it does not have the same priority of library has . In addition only small part of students attend sport activities . For example , in my university number of students who use the library is much more than students do sports activities .    \n",

First of all , authentic exhibits cannot be completely displayed only by images and videos . It is like travelling to a place is much better than viewing the landscape of that place on TV or photos , so the best method to learn one thing is to experience it . Furthermore , museums and art galleries preserve some culture heritages ; therefore , these buildings will not disappear unless people abandon their culture .    \n",

For example , nowadays horrendous images are displayed on the cigarette boxes to illustrate the consequences of smoking . As a result , statistics show a slight reduction in the number of smokers , indicating that they realize the effects of the negative habit . Not only that , the magnificent photograph captured by Kevin Carter , which portrayed a starving Sudanese child struck by extreme poverty has successfully highlighted the plight faced by the citizens in Sudan . Apart from that , images are also widely used in newspapers , magazines and advertisements . Thus , it is undeniable that images in the absence of words can obviously claim the attraction of many .    \n",

Another supporting reason is that television companies import foreign programmes from time to time and audiences might accept their ideas which maybe otherwise not welcomed to local culture .

Secondly , laws and rules are there for people therefore it is necessary to have a look behind crime for instance \" a women steals feed for her child should be treated same as a women , who steals for her drug addiction \" . The person who committed crime first time and the professional criminals should not be imprisoned at same place .    \n",
